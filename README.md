# Google Cloud Datastore

> Note: This repository contains low-level Java and Python client libraries for Google Cloud Datastore.
> For more idiomatic and usable client libraries in these languages, please visit the [Google Cloud Client Libraries for Java][26] and [Google Cloud Client Libraries for Python][27] repositories. You can also find the full list of supported client libraries in a variety of languages on the [Client Libraries page][24] of Cloud Datastore.

Cloud Datastore is a highly-scalable NoSQL database for your applications. Cloud Datastore automatically handles sharding and replication, providing you with a highly available and durable database that scales automatically to handle your applications' load. Cloud Datastore provides a myriad of capabilities such as ACID transactions, SQL-like queries, indexes and much more. For more information, see the [Cloud Datastore documentation][4].

This repository contains clients that are deliberately low-level and map directly to the underlying Datastore RPC model. They're designed to provide more flexibility to developers and higher level library implementers.
